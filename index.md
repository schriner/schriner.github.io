### Bio
During summer of 2018, I interned at Cisco within Emerging Tech and Incubation. My team was developing PoC solutions for networking. During my internship my primary responsability was simulation development for [Patent: US 1060893](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/0f/69/a5/9a6814565628a9/US10608930.pdf). Additionally I developed an understanding of Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Following my internnship I continued as a part-time, remote contractor for continued development on the networking PoC. 

In January of 2020, I began working for Trail of Bits in Research and Development. I contributed to Symbolic Execution, Datalog, and Binary Translation research tools during this time.
