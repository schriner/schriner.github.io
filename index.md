BS in Computer Science  
BS in Mathematics and Computer Science  

### Bio
During summer of 2018, I interned at Cisco within Emerging Tech and Incubation. My team was developing PoC solutions for
networking. During my internship my primary responsibility was simulation development for 
[Patent: US 1060893](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/0f/69/a5/9a6814565628a9/US10608930.pdf). Additionally, 
I developed an understanding of Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Following my internnship I continued as a 
part-time, remote contractor for continued development on the networking PoC. 

In January of 2020, I began working for Trail of Bits in Research and Development. I contributed to Symbolic Execution, 
Datalog, and Binary Translation research tools during this time. I also served as Principal Investigator for DARPA 
contracting during this time. 

I'm interested in Research and Development focused on Security and Numerical Computing. I'm experienced with LLVM, C++, 
Python.
